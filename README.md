Wallys SAAS Widgets is a made up company that gets its revenue from subscription sales.
These subscriptions are paid for in either USDC, ETH or WBTC crypto currencies. 

Our objective is to build a solution to manage their treasury.  Wallys needs to keep a threshold of 40% USDC in its treasury with the remaining 60% made up of crypto coins.  The bot needs to manage the buy and sell of these three currencies to keep the funds of USDC at optimum levels for operating expenses.  

The bot also needs to increase the value of the treasury by trading the income, depending on the movement of the two crypto currencies.

By the end of the month the balance should sit at 40% USD and 60% crypto currencies.  During the month the bot will trade the currencies.  The operations the bot performs should be as successful as possible.
 
We will collect data for 3 years to model and predict and analyse the success of our bot.  

We will use Prophet and Linear Regression for predictions.
